        <h3>Who am I and what do I do</h3>
        <h4>
		<p> 
		I am a software engineering senior at Auburn University, and am currently working in the IT department of Building Science.
		When I am not at work, I try to keep myself gainfully employed, either with
		whatever my <i>"Big Personal Project"</i> is at the time, or by making things down at my forge.
		If you are interested in learning more about what I do, feel free to look at my blog, or the forge blog. I also have my CV linked for any employers who have happened across my site.
		Please enjoy your stay here and feel free to look around, I am happy to have you.
